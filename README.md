# MetaMask
Add Logo

Loading Cryto Logo
--------------------
I've added a function to load logo in loadCrytoLogo.js.
This function can be reused for all other logos to implement the proper spacing. 
Currently the image url is hard-coded as the request is to use the provided image but could be changed to accommodate API.

Styling
--------
The colors in crytologo.scss are specified as best I could with the color picker tool in image editing software.
Colors defined in hard-code are those I could not match in metamask-extension/ui/css/design-system/colors.scss.

Result
------
The result of the codes is in Harmony-Logo-Added.PNG
